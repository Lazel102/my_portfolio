# My portfolio

Hi I am Yannick, I just finished two Bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Social Science. Meanwhile I spezialized in the collection and analysis of data of various forms. This portfolio I am trying to showcasse some of the projects I did in the past, to give anyone who is interested in my work an overview of what I am doing. If you have further questions do not hesitate me via github or my [university email](lazel102@hhu.de).
