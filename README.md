# My portfolio

Hi I am Yannick, I just finished two Bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Social Science. Meanwhile I spezialized in the collection and analysis of data of various forms. This portfolio I am trying to showcasse some of the projects I did in the past, to give anyone who is interested in my work an overview of what I am doing. If you have further questions do not hesitate me via github or my [university email](lazel102@hhu.de).


## Project 1 : SciTok : A Web Scraping Tool for Social Science Research

For my bachelor's thesis in Computer Science, I created SciTok, a specialized tool designed for researchers to scrape and integrate TikTok data into theoretical models. Despite its widespread usage and growing interest among social scientists, TikTok currently does not provide a means for researchers to access and analyze its data.

SciTok bridges this gap by allowing social scientists to collect and analyze TikTok data efficiently. The tool has been specifically tailored to meet the needs of social scientists, with a strong focus on facilitating social network analysis. Throughout the development process of the initial prototype, emphasis was placed on ensuring the tool's accessibility for scientists without a background in computer science, as well as addressing legal and ethical concerns related to social media data analysis.
